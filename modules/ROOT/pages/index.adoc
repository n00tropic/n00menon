= n00menon Docs

Tiny Node/TypeScript demo service that exposes two trivial APIs and acts as a canary for the wider workspace tooling.

== Quick start

[source,bash]
----
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm run docs:build
node dist/index.js
----

== API surface

* +ping(): string+ → returns +"pong"+; use as a health probe.
* +greet(name: string): string+ → returns +"Hello, <name>!"+.

== Repository map

* +src/index.ts+ — runtime exports and the tiny CLI entrypoint.
* +tests/+ — Vitest smoke coverage; keep the threshold at ≥80%.
* +docs/+ — canonical Markdown docs plus generated Typedoc HTML under +docs/api/+.
* +modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc+ — Antora page (synced automatically; do not hand-edit).
* +package.json+ — scripts for build, tests, docs sync, and validation.

== Docs + automation

* Edit +docs/index.md+ as the single source of truth for n00menon docs.
* Run +pnpm -C n00menon run docs:sync+ to refresh +README.md+ and the Antora page.
* Regenerate API HTML with +pnpm -C n00menon run docs:build+.
* CI uses +pnpm -C n00menon run validate+ to guard drift and make sure the docs build stays green.

== Contributing

* Keep exports in +src/index.ts+ documented with TSDoc comments.
* Add tests in +tests/+ for new behaviour; hold coverage at 80% or higher.
* Use pnpm 10.23.0 and Node 24.11+; run +pnpm test+ and +pnpm run validate+ before raising a PR.
