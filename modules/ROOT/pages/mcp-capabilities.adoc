= MCP capabilities (docs & planning)

Use these MCP endpoints to keep agents aligned with tagging and search hygiene:

* `docs.captureTypesenseSummary` — reads the latest `docs/search/logs/typesense-reindex-*.log.json` summary.
* `docs.tagEnforce` — runs the tag enforcement/propagation routine across the workspace (mirrors `tag-propagate.sh`).
* `planner.refreshPlans` — regenerates plans from briefs with updated doc/search context.

Operational notes:

* Prefer these capabilities instead of ad hoc shell when running from control tower.
* Capabilities are exposed in the control tower MCP server; ensure it runs with access to the workspace root.
